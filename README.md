# ⚡ WattWise — Internal Energy Credit Market

### 🔋 A Peer-to-Peer Blockchain-Based Energy Credit System for Smart Buildings

WattWise transforms a residential tower into an intelligent *micro-grid* — allowing apartments to trade clean energy *directly* with one another using **Energy Credits (EC)** instead of cash.

This project was built for a hackathon to demonstrate a **community-level peer-to-peer energy trading simulation** powered by **blockchain verification**, **AI-driven demand simulation**, and a **credit-based internal economy**.

## 🌍 Concept Overview

### 🧠 The Problem
Traditional grids are inefficient — even within the same building.  
Example:  
- Flat **12A** exports solar energy to the grid for ₹3/kWh.  
- Flat **12B**, right next door, buys energy back for ₹10/kWh.  
→ The utility takes the 70% cut.

### 💡 The Solution
WattWise introduces an **Internal Energy Market (IEM)**:
- Each flat is both a *consumer* and a *producer* (prosumer).
- A **blockchain ledger** ensures transparent, tamper-proof EC trades.
- An **AI autopilot** optimizes buying/selling based on generation, demand, and battery SoC.
- Energy is valued in **Energy Credits (EC)** — 1 EC = 1 kWh equivalent.
